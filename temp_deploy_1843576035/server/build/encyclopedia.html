      <h2>Bodh Gaya — Introduction</h2>
      <p>Bodh Gaya (also spelled Buddh Gaya) is a town in southwestern Bihar, India, situated west of the Phalgu (Phalgu/Phalgu) River.

The Mahabodhi Temple complex marks the site and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
      <p>The town grew around the Mahabodhi Temple and the Bodhi Tree. Archaeological remains, inscriptional evidence and historic restorations document a long history of religious patronage and pilgrim activity from ancient through medieval and modern periods.</p>

      <h2>Mahabodhi Temple & the Sacred Landscape</h2>
      <p>The Mahabodhi Temple stands on the traditional site of the Buddha's enlightenment. A shrine marking the spot dates to at least the Mauryan age; the current structural core was erected and expanded in later centuries. The temple group includes the Bodhi Tree (a descendant of the original pipal), a stone railing fragment from the early period, votive stupas, and nearby monasteries from several Buddhist traditions.</p>
      <p>A museum on site houses relics and archaeological finds. The Mahabodhi Temple is the focal point for international Buddhist pilgrimage, including festivals and international ceremonies organized by the Mahabodhi Society and local authorities.</p>

    <section id="buddhism">
      <h2>Buddhism — Overview</h2>
      <p>Buddhism developed from the teachings attributed to the Buddha, a teacher who lived in northern India between roughly the mid-6th and mid-4th centuries BCE. Core themes include the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the doctrines of karma and rebirth, and the goal of liberation (nirvana).</p>
      <h3>Major traditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Theravada</strong> — predominant in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos; emphasizes Pali texts and monastic discipline.</li>
        <li><strong>Mahayana</strong> — widespread in East Asia; includes Zen, Pure Land, and other schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Vajrayana</strong> — tantric forms prominent in Tibet, Bhutan and Himalayan regions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="history">
      <h2>Historical development</h2>
      <p>From a local movement in northeastern India, Buddhism spread through royal patronage (notably Ashoka, 3rd century BCE) and trade networks across Asia. Over the centuries it produced large monastic universities, schools of thought, and major cultural achievements in art, literature, and architecture. The Pala and Gupta eras were notable high points for Buddhist learning in the subcontinent.</p>
      <p>By the medieval period, Buddhism had largely declined in India but flourished elsewhere in Asia; in recent centuries there has been revival and renewed interest in modern India.</p>
